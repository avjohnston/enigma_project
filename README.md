## Self Evaluation

### Functionality
* I believe I meet a 3 for functionality, based on the fact that I have successfully implemented the encrypt class, decrypt class, and the CLI successfully allows you to encrypt and decrypt a message based on the specs we were given in the project requirements. I even added a bit of functionality, where in the message/encrypt/decrypt test files you can add in (on new lines) a key and date that you would like to use, instead of having ones randomly generated for you, or if you just input a message it will randomly generate one and encrypt/decrypt your message.

### Object Oriented Programing
* I believe I have earned a solid 3.5 for OOP. My project is clean, concise and the methods are well named. All of my classes are just a few methods, and I have only one method longer than 10 lines, and couldn't find a way to shorten it. I worked hard to make sure my enumerables and data structures are the most efficient tools for the job and can clearly explain why I used what I did in every part of this project. The only thing that may be of question is that in some methods I am taking 4-5 arguments, which I know can be problematic, but I believe this was the right choice for my project because it allowed me to cut out a lot of methods that were basically just repeated code with small differences. I think you will understand why I did that when you go in and look at my code.

### Test Driven Development
* For testing I believe I have earned myself a 3. Some of these methods can be difficult to test, and since some methods take so many arguments (some being optional) there are a lot of assertions in my test classes. However I am at 100% coverage and testing every line of code that is being called. I am testing all methods for each argument and all pieces of functionality. I did not use mocks and stubs, instead using the example `hello world` with a specific key and date that we were given in the project requirements. I believe that my testing shows each method is functioning correctly and doing exactly what it is I am expecting each method to do.

### Version Control
For version control, I have more than 30 commits and was using a PR workflow throughout the entire project.
